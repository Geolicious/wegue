# Wegue App Dir
This directory will contain your Wegue Application.
By using the command `npm run init:app` this directory is populated with
the contents from the `app-starter/` dir.

You can develop your Wegue app by modifying/adding files here, under the `app/` dir, for example:

* modifying the core `.vue` files like `app/WguApp.vue` and `app/WguAppTemplate.vue`
* placing or modifying custom/app-specific components under `app/components`
* placing or modifying  static content like configuration, data, icons and css under `app/static`.

The default config file is `app/static/app-conf.json`.
